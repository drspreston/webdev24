        <p>Write something about your website here in 2 to 3
            paragraphs. Describe what this website is about, what
            you have to offer to your visitors, and how they 
            can learn from. The front page of your site will 
            bring your visitors in or drive your visitors away from
            your site. So, it is a very good idea to write something
            appealing and inviting.
