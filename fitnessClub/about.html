                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as 
                    part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. 
                        Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands 
                        forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then 
                        jump up from a squatted position. </dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up 
                        position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as 
                        long as you can. </dd>

                    <dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
                    <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in 
                        a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly 
                        as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
